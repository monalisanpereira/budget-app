# Budget App

Fullstack application created from scratch as my final project for the [HarvardX CS50x Course](https://certificates.cs50.io/fa2e6946-b3b3-4920-a5d6-86e24a8e5e9a.pdf?size=letter).

## Status

Complete âœ… (but I plan on using it in the future to practice adding some new functionality)

## Description

A budget app for people who live in the same house track their expenses together.

## Skills

- Ruby on Rails
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Notes

Template credit: [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin)

### Ideas for additional functionality
- confirm account via email
- option to change password
- archive budget
- add support to different languages
- add testing
- add logical deletion <!-- (paranoia gem) -->
- introduce a more sophisticated auth system <!-- (devise gem) -->
